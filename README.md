## GO Battleships

Simple project to learn the fundamentals of GO. Battleships that used I/O for UI

Covered
- Pointers
- Not OOP (structs)
- Syntax
- Misc stuff like enums, errors, input, concat strings

Possible improvements to add 
- Different size battleships (hardcoded to size 3)
- Detection at start if tile contains battleship part already
- Message when a battleship is sunk
- Label Grid consistently with Input e.g (0,1) rather than A2
- Actual UI (obviously...)
- Remove sentimental GO Hello World at program start :/
